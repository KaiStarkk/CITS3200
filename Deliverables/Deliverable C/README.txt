STINT Analyser for Catapult Sprint README
=========================================

INTRODUCTION
=============

STINT Analyser is a side program designed to be used alongside Catapult Sprint, a GPS based sports analysis program. STINT Analyser removes the work of manually selecting playing times of players to be analysed in a game.

STINT Analyser reads in pre-made .csv files created from Catapult Sprint. These files are then processed and outputted as a .vid file for use in Catapult Sprint.

REQUIREMENTS
==============

- Windows XP/7/8
- Java JRE8
- Catapult Sprint

INSTALLATION
============

Install as per instructions in INSTALL.txt.

CONFIGURATION
==============

In order to use STINT Analyser, .csv files must be exported from Catapult Sprint having the correct fields in this order:
Time, Plyr. Load, GPS Time, GPS Latitude, GPS Longitude

To create a .csv file with the correct fields:
1. Open Catapult Sprint and load a .raw player file in the Graph Setup tab
2. In the Data/Export tab select the 5 columns above and ensure the order is matching
3. Select "GPS Rate"
4. Select "Export to CSV" and save the .csv file in the same folder as the .raw file

Upon opening STINT Analyser, a graphical user interface (GUI) appears.

User then can fill in the various fields including:
1. Select the player .csv files that are to be analysed/the folder where .csv files for the match are stored
2. Select the grounds library file
3. Select the grounds for the match
4. Input start/finish times for each period of the match
5. Press Analyse.

DIRECTORY ORGANISATION
======================

If chosen to download the source for STINT Analyser:

The source directory includes 2 folders, test and src.
The src folder contains all the source files for STINT. STINT is broken up into 5 sub-folders, with the components to run the program: 

 - Analysis, which includes all the heuristics for solving ie the GPS analyser and Player load analyser as well as the Evaluator, which combines the heuristics for final compilation.

 - Data, which contains all the data structures used for containing inputs from the user and .csv file.

 - Grounds, which deals with all the processing for later use in GPS heuristic analysis. This includes a data structure for GPS coordinates, a structure for grounds and an IO module to read in he grounds file.

- Stints, which includes the 2 main data structures for analysis, Stint and StintSet. Stints holds data for each stint in the game, StintSet holds the set of stints.

- UI, which is the folder that contains all the processing for the user interface.


The test folder contains the testing classes for Stint Analyser. These are again broken up into the same 5 sub-classes.
